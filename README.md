SALES INSIGHT OF ATLIQ HARDWARE 

Project Description-
I have created an interactive tableau dashboard for getting sales insight of a hardware company "Atliq Hardware" using its sales database.It can 
help the sales manager to check upon the regions where sales are declining and where the sales are good, for better profit.

-> I have installed Tableau Desktop and connected it to MYSQL server where I have sales database.
-> Then I have created a datamodel(starschema) that connects different data tables and establishes relationship tables.
-> Tableau is very powerful tool so to create a star schema you have to just drag and drop tables.
-> After this I have performed some data cleaning.
-> Now, since data is clean I have created an interactive dashboard.


Since Tableau desktop is paid , so you can check my dashboard only if you have access to it.
